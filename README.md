# FILM COMPANION
*This is a project I sometimes work on when I have some time off. It has been quiet for a while...*

## THE IDEA
- Use/create database with film info (speed(iso), nominal speed, max push/pull, ways to develop, etc.) and examples.
- Shooting notes (which roll, speed(iso), shutter speed, aperture, etc.).
- Info about Sunny16 rule and other rules.
- Use/create database with camera and lens info.
- Setting suggestions (based on history/already taken pictures)
